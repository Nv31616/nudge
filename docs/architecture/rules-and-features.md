# Rule capabilities and in-app feature detection

Covers what a *rule* can express beyond a plain block: schedules, in-app feature blocking
(Shorts/Reels/TikTok), grayscale, the user-editable overlay message pools, and the rule editor.
**Read before touching `domain/` rule models, `InAppDetector`, `NudgeMessages`, the rule editor, or the Settings screen.**

## Capabilities

- **Schedule-based rules** — day-of-week + time-of-day, overnight schedule support (spans midnight)
- **In-app feature blocking** — YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels/Explore, TikTok detection via AccessibilityService
- **Grayscale mode** — force screen to grayscale (requires ADB: `adb shell pm grant com.astraedus.nudge android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`). Grayscale guide in Settings.
- **Rotating motivational messages** — shown on overlay screens when blocks trigger. **User-editable (v1.6.0)**: defaults live in `ui/overlay/NudgeMessages.kt` (delayTitles/delaySubtitles/hardBlockMessages); users override via Settings → Personalize → "Edit block messages" (`ui/screens/settings/MessagesEditorScreen.kt`), stored as 3 multiline strings in `NudgePreferences` (`customDelayTitles`/`customDelaySubtitles`/`customHardBlockMessages`, one message per line, empty = defaults). `NudgeMessages.resolvePool(customRaw, default)` is the pure resolver; `BlockOverlayActivity` reads the prefs once via `runBlocking{ first() }` before `setContent` (avoids a default→custom flash) and passes resolved pools into the overlay composables (which still `remember { pool.random() }`).
- **Instagram home feed detection** — `InAppDetector` now detects Instagram's home feed (when Home tab is selected, no other tabs active) and treats it as REELS-equivalent. Home feed scrolling counts toward interaction counter and auto-kick the same as the Reels tab.
- **Rule editor UX** — info tooltips on all sections, block mode descriptions, per-app rules summary with enable/disable
- **Settings** — version links to GitHub repo, source code & feedback link
